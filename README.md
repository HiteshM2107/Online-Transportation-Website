# Online-Transportation-Website
This website was built by me while undertaking the Web-dev course. The website allows the user to login and make a booking. There is also an option for sign up where a user can register by providing his credentials. 
    
The user also gets an option to update his mobile number as well as his profile picture. The website manages session and also gives the facility of reviewing the orders after placing them.
  
Note: The website is uses an offline data base. The projects runs smoothly when you enable the Tomcat and Apache servers on your machine using Xampp control panel. The website is not deployed as it stores and retrieves data from an offline DB.
